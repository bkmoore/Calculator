Objective-C Calculator

This is an Objective-C Calculator based on the example code from the book "Building Cocoa Applications" by Simson Garfinkel & Michael Mahoney, O'Reilly, 2002.

I have made several enhancements to the example code.

1. Added a decimal button, and programmed appropriate behavior.
2. Created a custom view object that handles the calculator display. This view displays the input key strokes, the accumulator value, and the selected operation.

I have made every effort to ensure the code compiles and runs cleanly. This code was tested on XCode 2.5 running on OS X 10.4.11 Tiger on a PPC Powermac G5.

I am an amateur / hobbyist programmer, so my implementation may not be the cleanest. I strived to leave clear comments explaining what my code does, when it's not obvious from reading the code. There may be cleaner ways to implement the same functionality. I don't claim to be a pro or even competent at Objective-C programming.

Have Fun, and make changes and learn.
